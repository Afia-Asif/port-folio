    Infectious diseases are caused by pathogenic microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, parasites or fungi; the diseases can be spread, directly or indirectly, from one person to another.
    Some infectious diseases can be passed from person to person. Some are transmitted by bites from insects or animals. And others are acquired by ingesting contaminated food or water or being exposed to organisms in the environment. Food born infection are very common in society and the consumption of food items  both cooked and uncooked are the basic need for the life there fore and a hygienic food consumption is very important, due to above describe facts the present study has been conducted as fulfillment of my Bs degree from this university. various kind of synthetic and natural antibiotics are used for combating these type of infections but due to the emergence of new varieties of pathogenic bacteria and MDR  the present study has been conducted and rather it is a continuation of the extensive researches going on in different laboratories of the world in the field of herbal medicine
    The study was done to evaluate the antibacterial activity of aqueous garlic extract against. Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The present study is suggestive aspect for the use of cost effective locally available herbs as a home remedy. It could be easily use for the prevention of gastrointestinal and other infectious diseases caused by bacteria as the garlic is a herb which is extensively used in our every day food making.
    Garlic has been used as a source of food and medicine for thousands of years. Garlic contains different biologically active materials like allicin which is act as a antibiotics. Allicin is a key component which is rapidly synthesized when garlic is squeezed. Allicin gives garlic its pungent flavor along with many health benefits. Garlic is also rich in protein, calcium, magnesium, iron, potassium, zinc, Moreover, it is an abundant source of certain vitamins like vitamin A, vitamin B6 and B1 and vitamin C. Garlic is commonly used as a spice and Condiment in the various cuisines of the world.  The purpose of this research was to estimate the degree of sensitivity of gram positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and gram negative bacteria Escherichia coli.  The results of the present study indicate different concentrations of garlic exhibits different inhibition zones against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. According to the dose response, the zone of inhibition was increased with increasing the concentration of garlic extracts. The degree of sensitivity was determined by agar well diffusion method and disc diffusion method. & antibacterial activity was also checked by the antibiotics of choice for bacteria under study, such as Chloramphenicol and Erythromycin.
