Garlic as an antibiotics <hr>
</h1>
<p>
    Garlic is an anti -bacterial agent that can actually inhibits growth of infectious agents and at the same time protect the body from the pathogens.
    Garlic has been found to help prevent many diseases. Numerous modern studies confirm that garlic has definite antibiotic properties and is effective against a wide spectrum of bacteria, fungi and viruses . In addition, the antimicrobial activities of garlic are linked to the presence of some bioactive compounds . Moreover, many studies have demonstrated that garlic can be more effective as a broad-spectrum antibiotic compared with conventional antibiotics. However, most previous studies have only focused on the antimicrobial activities of garlic and garlic-derived organ sulfur compounds or the difference between garlic or garlic-derived organ sulfur compounds and standard antibiotics, while little is known about the potential of fresh garlic extract (FGE) to improve the susceptibility of multi-drug resistant strains to conventional antibiotics.(52)
    Even the forefather of antibiotic medicine Louis Pasture acknowledged garlic to be an effective antibiotic. Some years later garlic was shown to have similar effect/activity as penicillin. Later studies should similar activity to modern antibiotic including Chloramphenicol. Even the blood of garlic eaters can kill bacteria and it is also reported that the vapor from freshly cut garlic can kill bacteria at a distance of 20 cm!(54)

    Antimicrobial effect of garlic <hr>
</h2>

<p>
    Allicin and other sulfur compounds are thought to be the major compounds responsible for the antimicrobial effect of garlic. Garlic is effective against a number of gram-negative, gram-positive, and acid-fast bacteria, including Staphylococcus, Salmonella,E.coli Vibrio, Mycobacteria, and Proteus specie

Review on test organism <hr>

</h2>
<P>

    Staphylococcus aureus is very important pathogen that causes a variety of diseases including skin infections. Gastro intestinal disease (*staph*) food poisoning, toxic shock syndrome and nosocomial infections acquired during hospitalization.
    Staphylococcus aureus is isolated on Mannitol salt agar which is a medium that is high in salt (75% NaCl) and contains Mannitol as a source of carbon and energy. S. aureus ferments the mannitol and causes the medium turn yellow.
    Escherichia coli is a bacteria that exists naturally as part of normal gut of healthy humans and mammals. It causes enteric diseases. However, there are relatively few strains of this strains of this organism, which are pathogenic to humans and are associated with food related illness[48]
    in this research we checked the antibacterial activity of gram positive and gram negative bacteria.i.e staphylococcus aureus and e.coli.
